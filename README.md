To Newbees I would Like you too First try C++ 
as there primary Language and after you have an 
idea about all the algorithm, you may switch 
to other languages, but I would recommend you to
use c++ as your only language in competitive 
programming as it has less runtime then other
languages.

## Notes:
1. The Python Codes i have used in this Repository are well Idented, and are built using python 3+ Interprter.
2. C++ Codes are made through g++ 8.2.0, C++14 standard Compiler.
